# Phsyics-Equator-backend
A code ecosystem that helps to find the equate any formula. The good part here is that the code finds the formula needed and/or operates on a formula (performs algebra) on it to give you an answer.


Physics equator has a raw formula database.
The first code called 'mathbo.py' takes the raw database and performs algebra on each formula to produce new formulas out of it and put it in the main formula database.

Through the solve.py code, you need to enter varaibles, their values and the unkown variable (the one that you need to find).
The code then finds the best formula, applies it and gives you a value.

I will be actively developing this project more. Any one who wishes to join can connect with me via this mail ID: armaan.gupta2020@gmail.com
